# Intelligent Document Processing at Scale

## Name
Intelligent Document Processing at Scale

## Description
This repository contains 2 strategies 

We will provide you with two different solutions to solve this use case. The first allows you to run a Python script straight from a Jupyter notebook, with this being the quickest way to hit the ground running.  The second approach is a turn key deployment of infrastructure using AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) constructs. It provides a resilient and flexible framework to process your documents and build out an end to end IDP pipeline.  Both solutions have been tested and processed millions of pages in a day.  

## Prerequisites For CDK Construct Solution
This codebase uses the  AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK). Also it requires Docker.

You can deploy this from a AWS Cloud9 instance, which has the AWS CDK and docker already set up.
The Source Bucket and Source Prefix are required.
